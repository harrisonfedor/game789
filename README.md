# game789

This game was created in June 2018 as a final project for AP Computer Science A during my Sophomore year of high school.
This is my first app created with Swift using a variety of online tutorials along with the Swift docs.

"789" spawned from the classic joke "Why is six afraid of seven? Because seven ate nine." 
The player's finger is the number 6 and has to dodge the angry (& hungry) 7s.
The score is time based and the game progressively gets harder as there are more 7s bouncing around the screen.
